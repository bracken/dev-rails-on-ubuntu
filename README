This project is meant to help set up a fresh Ubuntu ennvironment for rails development.
Everytime I have to set up a new machine I can never remember exactly which packages
and gems to install. So I wrote this for myself, but I thought others might find it
useful as well.

If you find errors or  have specific improvements just add an issue on github.

The current usage is like this:
dev-rails-on-ubuntu [-rdoc-ri] [-no-mysql] [-h,--help]

-h,--help	Show this help
-rdoc-ri	By default gems are installed without documentation ("--no-rdoc --no-ri"), this option enables documentation
-no-mysql	This flag disables the MySql install

The following Ubuntu packages are installed:
Base files:
	build-essential ruby ruby-dev ri rdoc openssl libssl-dev libopenssl-ruby irb
Git:
	git git-core git-completion gitk
MySql:
	mysql-server mysql-client libmysql-ruby libmysql-ruby1.8 libmysqlclient15-dev
Sqlite:
	sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libsqlite3-ruby

These gems are installed:
rails
mysql
sqlite3-ruby
rspec 
rspec-rails
cucumber
capistrano
wirble

An .irbrc that adds irb auto-completion and syntax highlighting is added as well. (if one doesn't already exist)
