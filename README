This project is meant to help set up a fresh Ubuntu ennvironment for rails development.
Everytime I have to set up a new machine I can never remember exactly which packages
and gems to install. So I wrote this for myself, but I thought others might find it
useful as well.

If you find errors or have specific improvements just add an issue on github. You'll
notice that there are only command line flags for a couple things. That's because I
haven't invested much time into making this a great general script for everyone. I
plan on making the script a little more flexible.


The current usage is like this:
dev-rails-on-ubuntu [-rdoc-ri] [-no-mysql] [-h,--help]

-h,--help	Show this help
-rdoc-ri	By default gems are installed without documentation ("--no-rdoc --no-ri"), this option enables documentation
-no-mysql	This flag disables the MySql install


Step by step how to use these scripts:
-Click the "Download" link at the top of the github page and download a .tar
-Open a terminal and go to the directory of the downloaded .tar
-Extract the .tar.gz file, enter directory, and run shell script
tar -zxvf bracken-dev-rails-on-ubuntu-*HASH*.tar.gz
cd bracken-dev-rails-on-ubuntu-*HASH*
./dev-rails-on-ubuntu.sh
-Complete the prompts as they appear


The following Ubuntu packages are installed:
Base files:
	build-essential ruby ruby-dev ri rdoc openssl libssl-dev libopenssl-ruby irb
Git:
	git git-core git-completion gitk
MySql:
	mysql-server mysql-client libmysql-ruby libmysql-ruby1.8 libmysqlclient15-dev
Sqlite:
	sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libsqlite3-ruby

These gems are installed:
rails
mysql
sqlite3-ruby
rspec 
rspec-rails
cucumber
capistrano
wirble

An .irbrc that adds irb auto-completion and syntax highlighting is added as well. (if one doesn't already exist)
